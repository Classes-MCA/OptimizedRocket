    "The goal of our project is to maximize the amount of fuel inside a rocket after it reaches a certain altitude after traveling with a constant acceleration. We decided to use equal step sizes for the altitude and vary the step sizes in the downrange direction. This amounts to effectively just changing the tilt angle of the rocket relative to the ground, but specifying it in terms of height and downrange position step sizes enabled a simpler optimization model where we could set the start and endpoints easier. Our optimization problem is thus\n",

    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maximize the mass of the fuel in the rocket when the rocket has arrived at a set position $(x_{target},y_{target})$ by varying the distance traveled in the x-direction for each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The rocket must start at $(x_0,y_0)$ and end at $(x_{target},y_{target})$\n",
    "* The rocket must accelerate with a constant value equal to three times the natural force of gravity on the surface of the Earth (ie. 3 g's)\n",
    "* Each successive step size in the x-direction must be no larger than twice the size of the previous step."

Then the required thrust  to maintain a constant acceleration of 3 g's is calculated from the diagram. The velocity of the gas is set, and so we are able to then calculate how much fuel mass must be expended on the current iteration."
