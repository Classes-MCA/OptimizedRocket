# OptimizedRocket
This repository holds the source code for the BYU ME EN 575 optimization project done by Mark Anderson, Adam Jackson, and Spencer Stoltz.

# Project Objective
***"Minimize the fuel consumption of a two-stage rocket flying on a trajectory through the atmosphere and ultimately acheiving orbital velocity."***

# Project Roles
- Mark Anderson: calculate the drag on the rocket at subsonic and supersonic speeds, manage source code using Git
- Adam Jackson: pull together the thrust, drag, and maneuvering calculations to create a trajectory function for the rocket
- Spencer Stoltz: calculate the thrust required by the rocket, in particular as the rocket changes mass during flight by consuming fuel and staging

# Repository Contents
- `docs/`: includes documentation and theory for the project
- `src/`: contains the source code for the project such that one can download the code and it will automatically work properly when run
- `test/`: a place to store temporary and permanent test files, code, and results. Some output produced from this code will be intentionally ignored to reduce the repository size

# Reasoning for Other Methodological Decisions
- Why use MATLAB?
  - MATLAB provides a useful optimization toolbox that will enable us to use well-trusted optimizers. Additionally, our group is primarily experienced in MATLAB and decided that it would provide the fastest way to begin to produce results
