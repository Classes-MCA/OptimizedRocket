% Purpose: To calculate the drag on the vehicle
%
% Inputs:
%   - velocity: the velocity of the rocket in (x,y) coordinates, measured
%               meters per second
%   - altitude: the altitude of the rocket in meters
%
% Outputs:
%   - drag: the total drag force on the rocket in Newtons

function [drag] = getDrag(velocity,altitude)
